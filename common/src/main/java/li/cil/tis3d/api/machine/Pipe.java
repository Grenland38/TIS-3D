/**
 * A pipe used to move data across {@link Port}s between {@link Module}s.
 * <p>
 * Each {@link Casing} provides eight ports to each installed module, each
 * pair of modules sharing two pipes, going in both directions. This abstracts
 * data transfer between modules.
 * <p>
 * Pipes operate in a synchronized manner, ensuring that when two modules
 * start reading and writing on a pipe between them in the same update step,
 * there is no execution-order-dependent behavior: the pipe requires a read
 * and write operation to be started via {@link #beginRead()} and
 * {@link #beginWrite(short)}, respectively, and will then, <em>after</em> the
 * modules finished their update for the current step switch to a transferring
 * state, so that the modules can finish the operation in the next update.
 * <p>
 * A transfer is completed by the receiver calling {@link #read()}, which will
 * reset the pipe and call {@link Module#onWriteComplete(Port)} on the writing
 * module.
 * <p>
 * So in short, a full transfer cycle looks like this:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Module A starts writing (or reading).</li>
 * <li>Module B starts reading (or writing) (in the same or a later update).</li>
 * <li>At the end of the update step, the pipe will enter transfer mode,
 * indicated by {@link #canTransfer()} being <tt>true</tt>.</li>
 * <li>Module B finishes the transfer by calling {@link #read()}.</li>
 * <li>Module A has it's {@link Module#onWriteComplete(Port)} method called.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note that at any time during the transfer cycle, one of the two parties may
 * cancel their reading or writing operation by calling {@link #cancelRead()}
 * or {@link #cancelWrite()}, respectively. The other part of the transfer will
 * <em>not</em> be explicitly notified of this change, but this can be checked
 * using the {@link #isReading()} and {@link #isWriting()} methods.
